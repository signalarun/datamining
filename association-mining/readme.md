## Confidence
 * Let X and Y be two sets of items. The confidence
   conf(X ∪ Y ) of the rule X ∪ Y is the conditional probability of X ∪ Y occurring in a
   transaction, given that the transaction contains X. Therefore, the confidence conf(X ⇒ Y )
   is defined as follows:
 * conf(X ⇒ Y ) = sup(X ∪ Y ) / sup(X)
